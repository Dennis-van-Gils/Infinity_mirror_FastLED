New transition (blend) algorithm:

Create snapshot of leds
Create start frame of new effect, called target

For each pixel of the full strip:
 Calculate in advance the per-pixel array 'fill_gradient()`. This will contain
 the hues to step through during the transition
 
 Next, we have to transition the brightness of the leds_snaphot frame towards
 the target frame. Use `value` parameter of function `HSV()`
